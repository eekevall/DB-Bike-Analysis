# DB-Bike-Analysis

An Exploratory Analysis of the Hamburg City Deutsche Bahn Call-A-Bike Bikeshare Data

## Project Overview

**Objective** : To create a dashboard with the key metrics and KPIs that will help Deutsche Bahn Bike Share fleet managers and operators understand the performance of their bike-sharing service and make data-driven decisions. [The data contains no information on revenue or customer profiles.]

**Scope** : The project focuses on the City of Hamburg Call-A-Bike bikeshare data from 2014 up to 2017.

### Data Sets

**The [bike_trips_stations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UW1rEPju8j20lkNqWpNhkGM7XvhRzNPJ/view?usp=share_link) data set used in this analysis** with the latitudes and longitudes for the start and end stations created by merging the [bike_trip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g5XCMDM2Ze7vzF_NEvmNetiKHopF2lyQ/view) data set previously cleaned by Jasmine Classen with the [OPENDATA_RENTAL_ZONE_CALL_A_BIKE](https://github.com/eekevall/LC-Rhein-Main-Hackathon/blob/main/Original_DB_Data/OPENDATA_RENTAL_ZONE_CALL_A_BIKE.csv) data set. (The merge process is documented [here](https://github.com/eekevall/DB-Bikeshare-Analysis/blob/main/Scripts/Deutsche_Bahn_Data_Set.ipynb).) 

The [original data sets](https://github.com/eekevall/LC-Rhein-Main-Hackathon/tree/main/Original_DB_Data) were downloaded from the [Deutsche Bahn website](https://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset/data-call-a-bike.html) The detailed data description can be found in the data dictionary [HACKATHON_CATEGORY_CALL_A_BIKE](https://github.com/eekevall/LC-Rhein-Main-Hackathon/blob/main/HACKATHON_CATEGORY_CALL_A_BIKE.pdf)
